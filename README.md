# Slippery_Bot
How big of a robot can YOU slide through the factory?

SUMMARY
Slippery bot is a game of a robot who slides through a factory eating gears. Whilst eating gears and gaining a higher score is fun, the more you eat the faster and longer you get, making it ever so harder to transverse round the factory. So do YOU have what it takes to eat gears and not crash?

HOW TO PLAY
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to change direction of the robot. 
Get the robot head to touch the gear on screen to get a higher score.
For every gear you eat the robot body gets longer and for every 5 gears you eat, you will move faster.
But don't hit into the edges of the factory or your own body otherwise it will be GAME OVER.
Get the highest score possible :)

HOW TO RUN THE GAME
To start the game run the code and play on your desktop.
The game will automatically shutdown when you lose. But you can always play again by running the code.
If you ever want to exit the game just press the escape button on your keyboard to shut it down.
